## HELLO THIS IS A SAMPLE COLOR FILE
# Having a # anywhere inside a line makes it a comment
# yes I got lazy while writting that.
# I will fix that latr

## USAGE
#
# (RED, GREEN, BLUE) [special arguments]
#       regex \(\s*(\d+)\s*,\s*(\d+)\s*,\s*(\d+)\s*\)\s*(random)?


## Colors
# Each color should be on a new line written as a tuple.
#    e.x (R, G, B)
# as of now, only RGB is supported
# Do not put a comma after the last tuple argument.
#    e.x This does NOT work: (54, 23, 12,)

## Special Arguments
# after the closing parenthesis, you can put any special arguments
# the only special argument as of now is 'random' which makes the
# starting position of the Walker random instead of in the center
# This random argument is useful when working with multiple colors


## Actual colors

#(57, 96, 172) this one looked bad

(251, 197, 49) random
(241, 90, 89) random
