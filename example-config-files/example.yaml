# Hello. This is an example configuration file.
# All of these attributes are required.
# You can have any number of walkers but you must have at least 1

# For all colors, you can either write them like
# like the one below or as a tuple (r,g,b) or in hex.
# when you write in hex, put quotes around it so it is
# not seen as a string
# Examples:

# background: "00fd3e"
# background: (12, 230, 123)
# background:
#   r: 45
#   b: 45
#   g: 45


background:
  r: 45
  b: 45
  g: 45
width: 1000
height: 700
iterations: 100_000 # default iterations for all walkers.
